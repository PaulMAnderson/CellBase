Release Notes
New features

- new database, data preprocessing and analysis functions
- new functions include setvalue.m, filterTrials.m, ultimate_psth.m, psth_stats.m, a set of functions for optical tagging analysis and many more
- complete documentation
- help headers, comments, code cleanup
- input argument handling with inputParser for most of the complex functions
- new directory structure for .m files
- insertdata.m, prealignSpikes.m, selectcell.m, addanalysis.m, addcell.m added functionalities
- most of the functions updating CellBase save a time-stamped backup (like addanalysis.m, delanalysis.m, etc)

Changes

- TheMatrix has been converted to a cell; it is kept compatible with previous versions (hopefully)
- Time stamp conversion is handled by a new preference
- getvalue.m returns values in the order of the cell IDs
- output arguments of findanalysis.m and findprop.m were changed

Bug fixes

- addcell.m: handling analyses when adding a new cell has been fixed
- partition_trials.m: NaNs are not considered a separate partition anymore
- MakeTrialEvents2_gonogo.m: TTLs parsed according to their channels
- findSegs2.m contained many bugs; findSegs3.m added, with hopefully most of the bugs eliminated; findSegs3.m renders findSegs2.m obsolete
- addanalysis.m: output arguments of an added analysis do not have to be wrapped in a cell array
